TEXT SEARCH

- Run with ./manage.py runserver.
- Search box on localhost:8000 should perform real time search queries from backend.
- 25 results are retrieved from the data file at a time.
- Using regular expressions and direct comparsion three categories of matches are retrieved.
- Exact (word is exactly the same as query), 'prefix'-match (query matches word in the begining) and mid-match (query occurs within the word somewhere in the middle).
- These are given a key value that indicates their result rank since dicts are sequenceless. 
- This is done so the file contents have to be only looped through once.
- The resulting dict with 25 values with position indicating keys are put through a few functions that using python sorted with custom comparison routines, output the values in an ordered list.
- This list is returned as json to the frontend.
